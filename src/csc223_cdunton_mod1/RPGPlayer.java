/**
 * Instructions You are designing a role-playing game (RPG) named "Wizards and
 * Warriors," which allows you to play as either a Wizard or a Warrior.
 *
 * There are different rules for Warriors and Wizards to determine how much
 * damage points they deal.
 *
 * For a Warrior, these are the rules: - Deal 6 points of damage if the fighter
 * they are attacking is not vulnerable - Deal 10 points of damage if the
 * fighter they are attacking is vulnerable
 *
 * For a Wizard, these are the rules: - Deal 12 points of damage if the Wizard
 * prepared a spell in advance - Deal 3 points of damage if the Wizard did not
 * prepare a spell in advance
 *
 * In general, fighters are never vulnerable. However, Wizards are vulnerable if
 * they haven't prepared a spell.
 *
 * You have seven tasks to complete: 1. Override each Player type's toString()
 * in the format "Player is a ____" (Warrior or Wizard) 2. Make all Players not
 * vulnerable by default 3. Allow Wizards to prepare a spell 4. Make Wizards
 * vulnerable when not having prepared a spell 5. Calculate the damage points a
 * Wizard produces 6. Calculate the damage points a Warrior produces 7. Add
 * helpful documentation in multi-line or Javadoc comments (cf. Hamming
 * exercise)
